### Workflow

Develop Incident Report using your corporate template.

It should include:

1. Executive Summary with short description of damage, actions taken, root cause, and key metrics (Time To Detect, Time To Respond, Time To Recover)
2. Detailed timeline of adversary actions, mapped to [ATT&CK tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) (you can use [Kill Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_chain), but 95% of all actions will be in Actions On Objective stage, which is not really representative, meaningfull and usefull)
3. Detailed timeline of actions taken by Incident Responders
4. Root Cause Analysis and Recommendations for improvements based on its conclusion
5. List of specialists involved into Incident Response with their roles

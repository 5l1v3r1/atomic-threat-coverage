### Workflow

Check email and its metadata for evidences of phishing attack:

- **Impersonalisation attempts**: sender is trying to identify himself as somebody he is not
- **Suspicious askings or offers**: download "invoice", click on link with something important etc
- **Psychological manipulations**: invoking a sense of urgency or fear is a common phishing tactic
- **Spelling mistakes**: legitimate messages usually don't have spelling mistakes or poor grammar

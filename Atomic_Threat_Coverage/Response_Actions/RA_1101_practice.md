### Workflow

> We do not rise to the level of our expectations. We fall to the level of our training.

Make sure that most of the Response Action has been performed on an internal exercise by your Incident Response team.
You need to make sure that when an Incident will happen, the team will not just try to follow the playbooks they see first time in their lives, but will be able to execute the actual steps in **your environment**, like blocking an IP or a domain name. 
It will not happen without practice.

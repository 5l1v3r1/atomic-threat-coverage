### Workflow

This Lessons Learned phase evaluates the team's performance through each step. 
Basically, this takes the incident report and answers some basic questions:

- What happened?
- What did we do well?
- What could we have done better?
- What will we do differently next time?

The goal of the Lessons Learned phase is to discover how to make the next incident response go faster, smoother, or ideally never happen at all.
Keep in mind that incident report is a key. If, for example, Time To Respond looks horrible, it was caused by some problem.
The only way to solve it is to bring it up and start working on it.

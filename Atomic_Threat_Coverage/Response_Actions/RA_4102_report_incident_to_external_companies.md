### Workflow

Report incident to external companites, i.e. [National Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/education-outreach/computer-security-incident-response-teams/national-csirts/).
Provide all Indicators of Compromise and Indicators of Attack you've observed.  

This Response Action could be automated with [TheHive and MISP integration](https://blog.thehive-project.org/2017/06/19/thehive-cortex-and-misp-how-they-all-fit-together/).
